  ## Description:
  The motivation behind this project was to create an application that manages a company's employee database. <br /><br />  This is a command-line application where the user is prompted by the Inquirer npm package to query a MySQL database, which then displays data using the console.table npm package and allows information stored in the database to be added or updated. It is initiated by running NodeJS. <br /><br />  For future development of this project, I would like to add the ability to update an employee's manager and be able to delete information.
